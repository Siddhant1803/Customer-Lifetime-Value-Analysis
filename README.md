# Customer Lifetime Value Analysis using Excel

#### Customer lifetime value (CLTV) estimates the total revenue a customer will generate for a business over their entire relationship, accounting for acquisition and service costs. By examining acquisition costs and generated revenue, we can identify the most cost-effective channels for acquiring and retaining high-value customers. Using data on customer channels, acquisition costs, conversion rates, and revenue, analyze CLTV to determine the most profitable channels for the business.
