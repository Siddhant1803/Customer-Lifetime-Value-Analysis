# Customer Lifetime Value Analysis using Excel

### Customer lifetime value (CLTV) estimates the total revenue a customer will generate for a business over their entire relationship, accounting for acquisition and service costs. By examining acquisition costs and generated revenue, we can identify the most cost-effective channels for acquiring and retaining high-value customers. Using data on customer channels, acquisition costs, conversion rates, and revenue, analyze CLTV to determine the most profitable channels for the business.

## Analysis

### Let’s start by visualizing the distribution of acquisition cost:

### Now let’s compare the cost of acquisition across different channels and identify the most and least profitable channels:

## So paid advertisement is the most expensive channel, and email marketing is the least expensive channel. 

### Now let’s see which channels are most and least effective at converting customers:

## Social media is the most effective channel for converting customers, while paid advertising is the least effective. 

### Now let’s calculate the total revenue by channel and have a look at the most and least profitable channels in terms of generating revenue:

## Here email marketing is the most profitable channel in terms of generating revenue. But there’s not a huge difference between the percentages of revenue generation from all the channels to call any channel the least profitable channel.

### Now let’s calculate the return on investment (ROI) for each channel:

## The ROI from email marketing is way higher than all other channels, while the ROI from paid advertising is the lowest. Now let’s calculate the customer lifetime value from each channel. 

### Based on the data we have, we can use the formula mentioned below to calculate CLTV:
Formula : CLTV = (revenue – cost) * conversion_rate / cost

## So the customer lifetime value from Social Media and the referral channels is the highest, but the Customer Lifetime Value from the Social Media channel is slightly better than the referral channel.

So this is how I analyze and compare the customer lifetime value from various channels.
